Ionic Firebase Boilerplate
====================

I've been having issues understanding how to handle user authentication with ionic and firebase, so I build the boilerplate to help me get an understanding. If you wanna use this to start your project you must change your FB address to your own.

I used the ionic-generator to start the boilerplate and built from there. This system has a working login and signup feature as well as logout. Feel free to add on whatever.
